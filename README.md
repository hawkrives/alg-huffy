# alg-huffy

Assignment:

1. In your team of two or three, implement the Huffman encoding algorithm shown on page 142.
2. Build an encoder that takes a file of ASCII characters, and encodes them as a long sequence of bits, using a prescribed association between characters and bit sequences. Here is an example of one way to handle input and output of bit sequences, and here is an example of reading a text file, one byte at a time.
3. Build a decoder that works with your encoder.
4. Demonstrate an example of using your encoder/decoder. What compression rate do you achieve, when you divide by eight? (Note that the bitset is output using a whole byte for each bit.)
